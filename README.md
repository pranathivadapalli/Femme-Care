WORKING METHODOLOGY
A.	NEWS API
This news API fetches articles relevant to women's health, lifestyle, and well-being from a popular news aggregator website.
The API utilizes an HTML template to display the retrieved articles in a card-based format, each card containing an image, title, source, description, and publication date.

1.	Initialization:
●	Upon loading the webpage, the JavaScript function fetchNews() is invoked.
●	This function constructs the API request URL using the predefined API key and the search query "Women".
2.	Data Fetching:
●	The fetchNews() function makes an asynchronous HTTP- ‘GET’ request for construction of URL.
●	Then, response from API is converted into JSON format for further processing.
3.	Data Processing:
●	bindData() function is called, passing the articles array as an argument.
●	JSON object data is stored in an variable called article
4.	Data Binding:
●	The bindData() function iterates through each article in the articles array.
●	For each article, a clone of the HTML template template-news-card is created.
●	The relevant article data (image, title, source, description) is extracted and inserted into the cloned template.
●	The cloned template is appended to the cards-container element.
5.	User Interaction:
●	When a user clicks on a news card, the fillDataInCard() function is called.
●	Corresponding article is opened

Overall, this working model efficiently retrieves and displays women-specific news articles, providing users with a convenient and informative resource.

B.	BMI CALCULATOR
This web page calculates a person's body mass index. It is a measure of body fat measured from attributes - height and weight. The BMI calculator is simple tool that can help people assess their weight status.
The BMI calculator is easy to use. Simply user enters weight and height, and the calculator will calculate your BMI and display it on the screen. The calculator also provides a brief interpretation of your BMI,
such as "underweight," "normal," "overweight," or "obese."

C.	MENSTRUAL CYCLE TRACKER
The menstrual cycle tracker was built using machine learning with the help of past cycles data.

DATA COLLECTION
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle where it was found that it does not cover all possible options such as irregularities in menstrual cycle which would help the machine learning 
model to capture all the patterns. Then we referred to article [2] to generate synthetic data which captured most of the patterns in the menstrual cycle.
The model uses the average (mean) and variability (standard deviation) of the cycle length to make realistic predictions. By incorporating the mean, the generated cycle length reflects typical observed values, 
and the standard deviation introduces variability, accounting for a range of possible outcomes. 
This statistical method improves the model's capability to simulate different and believable scenarios, ultimately enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the generated results. 
Then the data which was generated was divided into 3 cases based on three different trends noticed in the Kaggle dataset.
In the first scenario, we have an ideal cycle where the period starts right on the first day, has a short duration, and maintains a consistent cycle length of around 30-32 days.
Moving on to the second scenario, there are some slight variations. The cycle length ranges from 28 to 33 days, occasionally extending to 35 days. In this case, the period length increases by a day or two compared to the first scenario.
The third scenario presents a more unpredictable pattern, with the period starting randomly in the middle of the cycle. This cycle shows significant variability, with cycle lengths ranging from 29 to 45 days
and period lengths spanning from 5 to 8 days.
A total of 50 different cycles of each case have been generated by the use of equation and was used for training the model.
